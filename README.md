<h1 align="center">PROBLEM STATEMENT :</h1> 
<p>Over the past years or so, small businesses(suppliers) that face financial stress :disappointed: while managing their working capital and this task has become even more challenging in this pandemic. Supplier has to wait around 6 months to get their money back from the buyers(e-commerce sites).
When supplier will not have enough money then he will not be able to buy the raw material to develop the products.</p>

<h1 align="center">SOLUTION : </h1>
<h2>BuyS Monefy :</h2> <p>As its name indicates it will manage the money transactions between buyers and suppliers to remove the financial stress from the supplier. 
In our project all the e-commerce sites like amazon, flipkart, myntra etc. are acting as a buyer and all the wholesalers/retailers those are registered with these sites are acting as a suppliers. </p>

<p>When the buyer buy any product in a bulk quantity from the supplier and not able to do the early payment to the supplier but as supplier needs money to purchase raw material for developing product so supplier will take a loan from bank.
Then there will be an agreement between the buyer and supplier that loan will be paid off by the buyer.
At the time of agreement the bank will take the collateral from the buyer so that buyer canâ€™t step back at the time of payment of loan.</p>

<h1 align="center">Outcomes/Benefits</h1>
<p>Our project will provide a comprehensive online platform that is user friendly, responsive and secure which help buyer, supplier and bank to manage their capital/money.
On this platform, buyers/suppliers can manage their money and accounts receivable and to make quick decision for their business.</p>
